\section{Introduction}
A graph $G=(V,E)$ is an abstract mathematical structure 
where $V$ represents a set of elements called vertices and   a set of pairs $e = uv  \in E \subseteq V \times V$ called edges of $G$. In the context of this work, we deal with  simple undirected graphs which have no loops and where edges have no directions, that is $e = \{u,v\}  = uv = vu \in E$.   Graphs serve as models of many real--world problems and relations between objects in biology, physics, social networks,  etc.~\cite{mashaghi2004investigation,pirzada2007applications,shah2019characterizing,doi:10.1137/S0895480100375831}. One of the most prominent classes of problems that have been studied for decades from theoretical, computational and practical aspects are dominating problems on graphs~ \cite{haynes2013fundamentals}. The basic problem of this class is the \textit{domination problem}. The subset $D \subset V$ is called a domination set iff each vertex $v\in V$ belongs to $D$ or there is an vertex $w\in D$ such that $uw\in E$. Finding the smallest possible dominating set $D$ of graph $G$ w.r.t.\ its cardinalty defines \emph{the minimum dominating set problem} (MDSP)~\cite{grandoni2006note}. This problem has many applications, for example analysing biological networks~\cite{nacher2016minimum}, document summarization~\cite{shen2010multi}, graph mining~\cite{chalupa2018order},  etc. From algorithmic point of view, this problem is NP--hard. It is solved by many exact approaches such as branch-and-reduce algorithms~\cite{van2011exact}, an approach that uses the fundamental cut-sets of graph~\cite{karci2020new}, etc. On the other hand, heuristic approaches are also dominant, for example a genetic algorithm~\cite{hedar2010hybrid}, simulated annealing~\cite{hedar2012simulated}, ant-colony optimization~\cite{ho2006enhanced}, among others. There are many generalizations of MDSP proposed in the literature:  the minimum weight dominating set problem~\cite{romania2010ant}, the minimum total dominating problem~\cite{yuan2019novel}, the minimum connected dominating set problem~\cite{butenko2004new}, etc.




In the course of this work, we study the \emph{minimum k-domination problem} (MkDP)~\cite{corcoran2021heuristics}.  Note that the definition for this problem is ambiguous in the literature. The first variant asks for finding a minimum cardinality vertex set $ D$ such that every vertex of $G$ is within distance $k$ from some vertex in $D$~\cite{chang1983k}. 
This paper considers the following definition.  A $k$-dominating set  $D$ of a graph $G$ is a subset such that every vertex does not belong to $D$ is adjacent to at least $k$ vertices in  $D$~\cite{lan2013algorithmic}. A minimum such k--dominating set is a solution of MkDP.  NP-completeness of the k-domination problem is established on split graphs, where the problem is studied from an algorithmic point of view, see details in the aforementioned citation. A Beam search approach to solve the MkDP is proposed by Gagarin and Corcoran   in~\cite{corcoran2021heuristics}. A few greedy approaches is firstly  proposed by Couture et al.~\cite{couture2006incremental}, and by Gagarin et al.~\cite{gagarin2013randomized} who proposed a randomized algorithm. 
Applications of this specific problem can be found in  distributed systems  ~\cite{wang2013minimising} where  a $k$-dominating set in a distributed system is a set of processors such that each processor outside the set has at least $k$ neighbors in the set.

In this work we propose another meta-heuristic approach to solve the MkDP, a variable neighborhood search (VNS). The main algorithm components of the approach are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A carefully designed fitness function that evaluates solutions  including also unfeasible ones; it takes into consideration two scores ($i$) the size of dominating set; ($ii$) a penalized measure that evaluated how far is the considered set from being a $k$--dominating. 
	\item A shaking procedure that systematically destructs feasible solutions and ensures escaping the algorithm from a local optima.
	\item An efficient local search mechanism that try to fix unfeasible solutions into feasible ones. It is equipped witch a fast partial evaluation of the fitness function in a constant time.
 
\end{itemize}
Contributions of the paper are as follow.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The proposed VNS is able to achieve new state-of-the-art results concerning real-world instances; it is compared to the two greedy and the BS approach from the literature. 
	\item VNS is able to quickly produce solutions of a reasonable quality which is not the case of the two state-of-the-art incrementally oriented approaches from the literature.
	\item Concerning the (five) large-sized instances, where BS could not finish within the proposed time limit, our VNS delivers in all cases a feasible solution quickly. (TODO: provjeriti ovo...)
\end{itemize}
